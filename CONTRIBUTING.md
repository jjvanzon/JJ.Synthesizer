### JJ.Canonical as Sub-Module

Some commits in history may use JJ.Canonical as a git sub-module.
To restore the ability to build and run the old commit, it is recommended to link the missing references to nuget.org (search for JJ.Business.CanonicalModel). Pick ones from around (or before) the same date.
