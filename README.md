Release 0.0.125 - "Additive Engine"
-----------------------------------

*2015-03-10*

This release introduces the foundational __Additive Engine__, laying the groundwork for future synthesizer development. While there is no user interface or live audio playback yet, core functionality is implemented and validated through test programs in the form of unit tests.

### Main Features

- __Operators__: Manages how data or signals are processed within the synthesizer, enabling various operations for sound generation.
- __Curves__: Modulation curves that evolve over time, shaping sound dynamically.
- __Samples__: Supports audio samples for playback and manipulation of pre-recorded sounds.
- __Audio File Output__: Generates and exports synthesized audio as files.
- __WAV Header__: The metadata associated with WAV files, ensuring the correct format for audio data.
- __WAV Header Detection__: Automatically detects and parses WAV headers to ensure correct file handling.

### Supported Operators

This version of the engine supports various types of synthesis and signal manipulation, including:

- __Sines__ (pure tone waveforms, the simplest sound wave)
- __Samples / Audio Files__ (pre-recorded sound manipulation)
- __Additive Synthesis__ (combines multiple sine waves or samples to create complex sounds)
- __Oscillators__ (periodic waveforms, modulating pitch, volume, and other sound aspects)
- __Delays__ (time-shifting effects for echo and delay)
- __Detune__ (slight pitch adjustments for sound enrichment)
- __Speed Control__ (altering playback speed, affecting pitch and duration)
- __Curves/Envelopes__ (modulating and shapes sound over time)
- __Volume & Pitch Control__ (including envelopes for dynamic adjustments)
- __Basic Arithmetic__ (mathematical operations for sound manipulation)
- __FM Synthesis__ (theoretical support for frequency modulation synthesis, not fully tested)

*Note:* Due to a limitation in this version, pitch envelopes do not work with freely drawn curves. However, pitch envelopes might work by using continuous math functions.

### Interpolation Options

The engine supports two interpolation methods for __Curves__, __Samples__, and __Audio Files__:

- __Blocky__ (step-wise interpolation)
- __Linear__ (smooth transition between data points)

### Samples

Supports the following sample formats:

- **8-bit** and **16-bit** audio
- **Mono** and **Stereo** channels
- **WAV** and **RAW** file formats

The engine also automatically detects and parses WAV headers when loading samples, simplifying the handling of audio files.
